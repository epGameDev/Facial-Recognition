# Project Overview:

> Issue Detected: The **Clarifai API** used for this project has been updated and no longer works as originally
> configured. Other models have since been available, like Microsoft's Face API, that I will leverage later.
> As for now, the facial recognition does not work.

As of 04/11/2023 this project has been updated to fix all npm issues regarding to security. This project has been laying dormant for some time and is currently being updated. 

Work is being done to source and price the new features of the site as well as trimming the project to create a faster more performant site. 

Thank you for your interest...
